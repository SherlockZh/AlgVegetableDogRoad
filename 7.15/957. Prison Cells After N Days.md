[957. Prison Cells After N Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/)

```java
public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
    Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    while(N > 0){
        int[] next = new int[8];
        map.put(Arrays.toString(cells), N--);
        for(int i = 1; i < 7; i++){
            next[i] = cells[i - 1] == cells[i + 1] ? 1 : 0;
        }
        cells = next;
        if(map.containsKey(Arrays.toString(cells))){
            N %= map.get(Arrays.toString(cells)) - N;
        }
    }
    return cells;
}
```
Let's take an example. Assume you are asked the state after 10 ^ 9 days.
You store the state in the map the first time you see a new state. Then when you see the same state again, you know that you have passed (lastSeen - currVal) state in between. So now you know your states repeat every (lastSeen - currVal) times. So finally you can mod the current N with that value to not repeat the same steps. Below is an example for 10^9 days.
[0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1]
1000000000

```
N -> N % (last_seen - curr_val) ==> result
999999985 -> 999999985 % (999999999 - 999999985) ==> 5
4 -> 4 % (999999998 - 4) ==> 4
3 -> 3 % (999999997 - 3) ==> 3
2 -> 2 % (999999996 - 2) ==> 2
1 -> 1 % (999999995 - 1) ==> 1
0 -> 0 % (999999994 - 0) ==> 0
```


```java
public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
    for (N = (N - 1) % 14 + 1; N > 0; --N) {
        int[] cells2 = new int[8];
        for (int i = 1; i < 7; ++i)
            cells2[i] = cells[i - 1] == cells[i + 1] ? 1 : 0;
        cells = cells2;
    }
    return cells;
}
