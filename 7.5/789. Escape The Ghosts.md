[789. Escape The Ghosts](https://leetcode.com/problems/escape-the-ghosts/)

Firstly, you calculate `manDist`, which is the Manhattan distance of the starting point to the target;
Next, for each of the `ghosts`, you calculate the Manhattan distance between that ghost and the target;
If this distance is smaller, then it means that this ghost would eat the pacman (because he would reach the target *before* the pacman) and hence we return `false`; else we return `true`.

```java
public boolean escapeGhosts(int[][] ghosts, int[] target) {
    int manDist = Math.abs(target[0]) + Math.abs(target[1]);
    for(int[] ghost : ghosts){
        int ghostDist = Math.abs(ghost[0] - target[0]) + Math.abs(ghost[1] - target[1]);
        if(ghostDist <= manDist)
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
